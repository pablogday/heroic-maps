# Heroic Maps — Roadmap

Living document. Update as items ship, get descoped, or new ideas land.

## In progress

_(nothing active)_

## Up next (big rocks)

- [ ] **#8 `.h3m` parser** — Standalone parser sub-project at `src/lib/h3m/`. Auto-fill upload form, backfill empty `victory_condition` / `loss_condition` for 2,958 scraped maps. Designed to be extractable to its own npm package later.
  - [x] **v0.1** — SoD/AB/RoE basic header (size, name, description, difficulty); test scaffolding; coverage script
  - [ ] **v0.2** — player blocks (counts, AI/human flags); win/loss conditions
  - [ ] **v0.3** — HotA family (1.0, 1.4–1.5, 1.6+ magic numbers, format extensions, extra towns)
  - [ ] **v0.4** — WoG, Chronicles
  - [ ] **v0.5** — wire into upload form for client-side auto-fill on file select
  - [ ] **v0.6** — backfill script: write parsed win/loss conditions into the DB
  - [ ] **v1.0** — minimap rendering from terrain (tile palette, sprite atlas — separate effort)
  - **Discipline:** every version bump must run `npm run h3m:coverage` and not regress the previous version's parse-success rate without a deliberate reason.
- [ ] **#6 AI series detection pass** — Long tail the heuristic missed (~95% of maps still untagged for series).
- [ ] **#16 Public API + RSS feed** — `/api/v1/maps`, `/api/v1/maps/{slug}`, `/api/v1/maps/{slug}/reviews`, `/api/v1/factions/{name}`, `/feed.rss`, `/feed.atom`. Same repo, versioned, rate-limited (Upstash or Vercel edge), CDN-cached, documented at `/api`. (~2 days max)
- [ ] **#9 Public user profiles** `/u/[username]` — their reviews, favorites, played stats. (~1.5 hr)

## Going live

- [ ] Buy `heroicmaps.app` from Porkbun (~$15)
- [ ] Wire DNS + custom domain in Vercel (30 min)
- [ ] Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` + Discord OAuth callback for prod (5 min)
- [ ] Custom R2 subdomain `media.heroicmaps.app` (30 min, after domain)
- [ ] Vercel Analytics or PostHog (15 min)
- [ ] Sentry for prod errors (15 min)

## Polish & nice-to-haves

- [ ] Smart search (Claude NL → SQL): "small map for 2 players, no underground" → SQL filter (~2 hr)
- [ ] "Tell me about this map" chat — Q&A on detail pages grounded in description + reviews (~2 hr)
- [ ] Playstyle filter (story / playable / sandbox / unknown) — heuristic now (30 min) → AI refine later
- [ ] Per-map JSON-LD for SEO (30 min)
- [ ] Rate-limit review submissions (one per minute per user, 30 min)
- [ ] Light moderation: soft-delete reviews, report button, simple admin allow-list (~2 hr)
- [ ] Better empty states for `/feed`, `/library`, `/stats` matching `/maps` parchment loader (30 min)
- [ ] Reviewer leaderboard on `/stats` (top 10 reviewers this month, 30 min)
- [ ] Review reactions (👍 / "this helped", 1 hr)
- [ ] Themed confirm-delete modal instead of native `confirm()` (45 min)
- [ ] Skeleton placeholders inside homepage activity strip (20 min)
- [ ] Sort options inside `/library` tabs (recent / oldest / by name, 30 min)
- [ ] Author field — scrape and display author names properly (1 hr)
- [ ] Map preview lightbox — click minimap → fullscreen viewer with zoom + pan + surface/underground toggle
- [ ] Diff view between map versions (when uploaders revise a map)
- [ ] Embed widget — `<iframe src="/embed/maps/slug">` for Discord servers / blogs
- [ ] Comments thread under reviews (small, no nesting)
- [ ] Share-a-screenshot — let users attach in-game screenshots to reviews
- [ ] Random map button — `/maps/random` redirects to a weighted-random map (~10 lines)

## Open UX items (flagged, not re-confirmed)

- [ ] Mobile nav ghost band post-redeploy — verify on phone
- [ ] Mobile difficulty tile end-to-end (desktop + mobile)
- [ ] Broader use of toast system across error/success flows beyond sign-in/out

## Trust & ops

- [ ] GitHub Support email about purging orphan commit `87144b8` (low priority — `backups/` was committed to public repo for ~30 sec)
- [ ] Confirm Neon PITR retention window in Neon UI (Settings → Restore)
- [ ] Possibly weekly `pg_dump` to R2

## Killed / parked permanently

- Sound toggle
- Thumbnail AI upscaling (cheap pixel-doubling already covers it)
- Splitting data layer into a separate service (keep public API in same Next.js repo)

## Shipped

- **#7 Real upload** — `/upload` accepts `.h3m`/`.h3c`/`.zip` (≤8 MB), validates metadata, uploads to R2 at `maps/uploaded/<slug>.<ext>`, writes `maps` row tied to `uploaderId`, redirects to detail page. 5 uploads/day per user. Manual metadata entry for now (auto-fill comes with #8).
